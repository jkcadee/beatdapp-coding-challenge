### SETUP
Make sure you have these frameworks/ technologies installed:
- Node.js
- React
- Express
- MySQL and SQL

This setup will assume that you understand/ know how to set up a React application with an Express server.

1. Open MySQL on the command line or other IDE.
2. Create a database called `expenses`.
3. Create a table called `expenseTracker` with the given `schema.sql` inside the database.

### RUNNING
1. Clone the repository and unzip the expense folder. 
2. Take out the expense folder and place it in the root directory (beatdapp-coding-challenge)
3. Once all the files are in the correct places, open up your IDE of choice or command line and run the `server.js` file
4. Open up command line and navigate to `expense`, run the command `npm start` in that directory. 

You should be good to go after that.
